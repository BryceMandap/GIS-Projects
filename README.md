# Spatial Inequality in the Los Angeles County

## Purpose of Project
The aim of this project is to investigate the underlying factors that contribute to spatial socioeconomic disparities in the Greater Los Angeles area. This will be achieved by examining the impact of variables such as race, income distribution, education, and gender on inequality levels, and by comparing areas experiencing these inequalities to those that do not. By analyzing these metrics, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the drivers of inequality and inform evidence-based policy interventions to promote greater social and economic equity in the region
