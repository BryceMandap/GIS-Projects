# Spatial Inequality in the Los Angeles County

## Purpose of Project
The aim of this project is to investigate the underlying factors that contribute to spatial socioeconomic disparities in the Greater Los Angeles area. This will be achieved by examining the impact of variables such as race, income distribution, education, and gender on inequality levels, and by comparing areas experiencing these inequalities to those that do not. By analyzing these metrics, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the drivers of inequality and inform evidence-based policy interventions to promote greater social and economic equity in the region  

## Methodolgy (Flowchart)
- The project began with formulating research questions on spatial inequality in US neighborhoods.
- The main focus was to understand factors driving socioeconomic inequality in the Greater Los Angeles area. 
- Key areas of interest were race, income levels, and education.
- Data layers were obtained and used to create informative maps, which were published on the ArcGIS website for wider access.

## Spatial Techniques Utlilized
- **Clustering Analysis**: identifying clusters of similar features or patterns to better understand spatial distribution and identify relationships between them.
- **Proximity Analysis**: Identifying features or locations within a specified distance from a given location or set of locations, to assess their spatial relationships.
- **Heat Mapping**: Creating a visual representation of spatial data using color coding to represent varying degrees of intensity.
- **Spatial Joining**: Combining two or more data layers based on their spatial relationships, to gain insights into the overlapping patterns and relationships between different features.
